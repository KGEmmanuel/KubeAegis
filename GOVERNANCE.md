# KubeAegis Governance

## Overview
KubeAegis is a community-driven project dedicated to providing constitutional infrastructure for Agentic AI. This document outlines the project's governance structure, decision-making processes, and the roadmap to neutral governance.

## The Bootstrap Governance Model (Phase 1)
*Effective Date: January 2026*

As a project in its incubation phase, KubeAegis currently operates under a **Bootstrap Governance Model** to ensure rapid iteration and architectural consistency during the initial launch.

### 1. The Benevolent Dictator for Now (BDFN)
Currently, the project founder (**KGEmmanuel**) serves as the interim BDFN. Responsibilities include:
* Final architectural decisions.
* Release management and roadmap prioritization.
* Reviewing and merging Pull Requests.

### 2. The Path to Neutrality (The "Sunset" Clause)
The BDFN model is **temporary**. KubeAegis is committed to transitioning to a democratically elected Steering Committee. This transition will be triggered automatically when **one** of the following criteria is met:
1.  The project reaches **3 active, independent maintainers** (from different organizations).
2.  The date reaches **October 1st, 2026 (Q4)**.

Upon this trigger, a Steering Committee election will be held according to standard CNCF voting protocols.

## Maintainers
* **Guillaume Emmanuel KALDJOB (KGEmmanuel)** - *Founder & Lead Architect*

## Code of Conduct
All governance activities are subject to the [KubeAegis Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
