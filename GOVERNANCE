# KubeCortex Governance Policy

The KubeCortex project is an open-source project managed by its community. This document outlines the governance model, ensuring that the project remains vendor-neutral and driven by technical merit.

## 1. Principles
* **Open:** The project is open to anyone to participate, contribute, and become a maintainer.
* **Vendor Neutral:** No single organization shall dominate the project's direction. We aim to adhere to CNCF standards.
* **Meritocratic:** Responsibilities and decision-making power are earned through active contribution.

## 2. Roles

### Contributors
Anyone who submits issues, pull requests, or documentation updates.

### Maintainers
Contributors who have shown dedication to the project and have been voted in by existing maintainers. Maintainers have the authority to merge Pull Requests and steer the roadmap.

## 3. Decision Making
The project strives for consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, decisions are made by a majority vote of the Maintainers.

### The "50% Rule"
To ensure vendor neutrality, **no single company or organization may hold more than 50% of the Maintainer seats.** If a hiring event causes a single company to exceed this ratio, the maintainer team will freeze voting rights for the excess members until the balance is restored (either by adding external maintainers or members stepping down).

## 4. Code of Conduct
We follow the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md). Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project administrators.

## 5. Updating Governance
Changes to this governance document require a Supermajority (2/3) vote of the Maintainers.
